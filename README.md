# Job Dataset Analysis and Visualization

In this project, I analyzed a job dataset using Python and several powerful data analysis and visualization libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, and Plotly. The goal was to uncover key insights into the job market and present them in an interactive format. I have also deployed it in web using streamlit.

### Key Analysis:
- **Job Title Trends**: Identified the most popular job titles over time.
- **Monthly Hiring Trends**: Tracked the fluctuations in hiring activity throughout the year.
- **Salary Trends**: Explored salary distributions across different roles, locations.
- **Top Countries and Companies**: Highlighted the leading countries and companies in terms of job availability.
- **Job Mediums**: Analyzed the most common platforms or mediums used for job postings.

### Web Application:
The analysis was deployed in an interactive web form using **Streamlit**, allowing users to dynamically explore the insights.
